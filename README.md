 # Debouncing Project

![Debouncing Project](path/to/your/project/banner.png)

## Introduction

The Debouncing Project is a web application that implements the debouncing technique to optimize the performance of an API request based on user input. It prevents excessive API calls by triggering the request only when the user stops typing for a specific duration.

## Features

- Debouncing of API requests to reduce the frequency of calls.
- Fetches data from an external API based on user input.
- Dynamically displays the fetched data in the results container.

## Demo

Provide a link to the live demo or the web page where users can access and interact with the Debouncing Project. If the project is not live yet, you can skip this section.

## Installation

To run the Debouncing Project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the index.html file in your web browser.

## Usage

1. Open the web page in your browser.
2. Type a search term in the input field.
3. Observe the debouncing effect: The API request will only be triggered after you stop typing for 500ms.
4. The fetched data will be displayed in the results container.
 
## Conclusion

The Debouncing Project demonstrates the use of the debouncing technique in JavaScript to optimize API requests based on user input. By debouncing the function that handles the API call, we ensure that the request is triggered only when the user has paused typing for a specific duration. This leads to better performance and a smoother user experience.
